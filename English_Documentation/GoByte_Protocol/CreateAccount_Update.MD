# Create an account

You can register a random offline key pair (including the address and private key), but this key pair will not be recorded by the GOBYTE network. To make this key pair an account in the GOBYTE network, you need to call one of the following three apis with an account already existing in the GOBYTE network:

- Directly call the Create Account api
- Transfer GBX to the new address

After the transaction is confirmed by the network, you can query the information of the account that matches the address in the GOBYTE network. Creating an account burns no GBX.
