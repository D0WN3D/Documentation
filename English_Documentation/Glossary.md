# Glossary

## Account	
Account credentials on GoByte's network are given by a key pair, which consists of a private key and a public key, the latter being derived from the former through an algorithm. The public key is usually used for session key encryption, signature verification and encrypting data that could be decrypted by a corresponding private key.
## API	
API is mainly used for the development of client terminals. With API support, token issuance platform can be designed by developers themselves.	
## Balance GBX
A GBX account shows the balance of GBX and other tokens and their USD equivalent.
## Block	
Blocks contains the digital records of your transactions. A complete block consists of the magic number, block size, blockheader, transaction counter and transactions. 
## Blockheader	
A blockheader is part of a block. It contains the hash of the previous block, the Merkle root, the timestamp, the difficulty and the nonce.
## Cold Wallet	
Cold wallet, also known as offline wallet, keeps the private key completely disconnected from any network. Cold wallets are usually installed on "cold" devices (computers or mobile phones staying offline) to ensure the security of GBX private key. Private keys are kept away from the network by utilizing QR codes for payment.
## Consensus	
The consensus mechanism verifies and confirms transactions very swiftly through voting by special nodes. If several uninterested nodes can reach consensus on a transaction, we can deduce that the entire network can also reach consensus.
## Freeze	
Freezing a certain amount of GBX earns users a GoByte Masternode to vote and participate to the network. Frozen GBX cannot be traded or used for transfer.
## Frozen account		
Unfrozen GBX re-enters circulation and can be traded.
## Google Protobuf		
Independent from language-neutral, platform-neutral mechanism, ProtoBuf is a flexible and efficient means of data structuralization which can be used for communication protocols and data storage. It is faster, simpler and more compact. You can customize your own data structure of ProtoBuf and use a ProtoBuf compiler to generate source code in mainstream programming languages like C++, Java and Python to easily easily converted between object and code.
## GRPC	
GRPC is a language-neutral, platform-neutral open-source RPC system, with which apps in the client end can directly invoke another app on a different device like local one. It facilitates the creation of DApps and decentralized services. Like many other RPC systems, gPRC is based on the following concepts: define a service and designate a way including the parameters and return type for it to be invoked remotely; deploy such an interface on server and run a gRPC server to process client end invoke; install a stub on the client end to allow remote invoke.
## Hot Wallet	
Hot wallet, also known as online wallet, allows user's private key to be used while online, thus it could be susceptible to potential vulnerabilities or interception by malicious actors.
## JDK	
JDK is the Java SDK used for Java applications on mobile devices and embedded systems. It is the core of Java development, comprising the Java application environment (JVM+Java class library) and Java tools.
## Private Testnet
Private testnet: its developers configure their ID and server IP according to GoByte's deployment configuration file to participate in testing. Only readily deployed developers are allowed access.
## Public Testnet
Public testnet: it is similar to GoByte's mainnet launched on Nobember 17, which everyone can visit and use.
## RPC 
Remote Procedure Call.	
## Scalability	
Scalability is a feature of the GoByte Protocol. It is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.	
## Bit/Bite	
Bit/Bite, replaced drop as the smallest unit of GBX.
## Master Node
The Master Nodes are the bookkeepers on GoByte network. They are responsible for the verification and packing of all transaction data broadcasted on the network, similar to witness in DPOS systems. Information of the MNs are posted on GoByte network for public access. The most convenient way to check out the list of MNs and their information is by using [GoByteâ€™s Blockchain explorer](https://explorer.gobyte.network/).	
## Throughput
High throughput is a feature of GoByte mainnet. It is also known as TPS, namely the maximum transaction capacity in a second.
## Timestamp	
The approximate of block production time is recorded as Unix timestamp, which is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC (1 Jan 1970).
## Transaction	
Transaction refers to the process of token transfer between different accounts.
## Transaction Broadcasting	
Transaction information is verified by nodes and broadcasted in the blockchain network.
