## What is GOBYTE?

GOBYTE is an ambitious project dedicated to the establishment of a truly decentralized Internet and its infrastructure.

## Key Features

+ High Throughput

Under GOBYTE consensus, a limited number of master nodes of high calculation performance are selected randomly as transaction validator, achieving high throughput by keeping the TPS of the entire network on an acceptable level. With its consensus, GOBYTE has surpassed Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of TPS.

High TPS guarantees low calculation delay, speeding up transactions to parallel the velocity of existing payment systems such as VISA and SWIFT, which makes daily payment a possibility.  

+ Low Cost Transaction

GOBYTE adopts a design with low cost transactions, which makes it easier for different vendors on GOBYTE to expand its user base and more commercially competitive .

+ User-friendly

GOBYTE is committed to building utility blockchain products with thorough research on  users’ demands and expectations.


## The Future of GOBYTE 

We aim to build a GOBYTE ecosystem that everyone can participate in and benefit from, with the GOBYTE network along with its many advantages as the cornerstone of our effort.

+ GOBYTE and its wide variety of affiliated modular apps not only render users reduced costs, but also improved convenience in daily life and financial return.
